# Pick-a-Part Database

http://www.pickapart.ca

A bash script that assumes the use of a mySQL database called "cars", and
creates the table to hold all the vehicle data.

The script then gathers all the data from the Pick-a-Part website and enters the
data into the database.

## stmhall Files

The files that have `stmhall` in the file name are used for my website where I
also have the database for public access.

The `pickapart.php` file is also used for the website.
